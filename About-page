            A charitable, non-profit, civil association founded on 10/5/2003
            with a youth initiative and obtained a license from the Ministry of
            the Interior No. 7278 and a certificate of registration from the
            Ministry of Youth No. 67/2007 and our keenness to activate the role
            of the association in serving the people of our Palestinian society
            in all its segments and in order to mobilize and strengthen
            capabilities And developing skills to build a future of prosperity
            and prosperity. Despite the fact that the association’s headquarters
            was subjected to total destruction during the war on August 26, 2014
            in Burj Al-Basha, and on August 9, 2018, for the second time, in
            Al-Mishal Building, the will of the workers and volunteers is still
            insisting on continuing to give and work to serve Our people despite
            all the surrounding circumstances.
